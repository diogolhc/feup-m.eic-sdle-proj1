## Description
In this project, we present a reliable load
balanced publisher-subscriber service on top
of the ZeroMQ library. Our service enforces
exactly-once semantics and is robust to faults,
except in some rare circumstances.

The service supports four operations: subscribe, unsubscribe, get, and put, which can be executed by a client. We consider that we designed and implemented this system correctly, and its features are working as intended.
